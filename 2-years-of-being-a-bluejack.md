> I wrote this for my little reminiscence of my first professional work. Big thanks to my coworkers and seniors.

Studying at Bina Nusantara University probably become dream college for some Indonesian people, or at least several friends of mine think so. And luckily I got my seat in Information System major in 2017 until 2021, where I have studied IT System and Analysis, Information Security, Database Systems, and other IT subjects.


Every student in Computer Science and Information Systems and other faculties should have known Bluejack or Lab Instructor SLC (Software Laboratory Center). The fame of Bluejack has been known by students, alumnus, and companies especially startups for various impressions like programming proficiency and a wide range of soft-skills.

## The reason I joined Bluejack

Some people might be asking ‚ÄúWhy do you want to work while studying? Isn‚Äôt it exhausting to do?‚Äù or similar to questions. Well, the answer may vary from person to person depending on their background. Some of my friends want the money (the salary is decent), some want the skills, and others want to try something they have never tried before or want to be active on campus besides sports clubs. And my answer is just like the others, being active on campus plus paid with an appealing salary is a good thing for me.

## Hellish Training Sessions

The first thing before entering Bluejack is training sessions. Nonstop code, tons of various exercises, fear of presentation, or even mental breakdown. Yes, that‚Äôs what all Lab instructors went through, we are proud of those experiences. I spent the full month of January with code, class, and exam.

How about enjoying me-time? I barely had me-time during that time, we were **trained for worst-case scenarios** where this might happen to every Lab Instructor during our 2 years of employment (extremely rare case).

This concept of risk-management by pushing the capacity of the learner to the extreme, resulting in greatly **improved stress tolerance, improved ability to learn quickly, adaptability to any situations**, and other various improvements that I can‚Äôt get in regular college courses.

## First Impression

> It's your first year in college, your first day in Bluejack and you are assigned with your partner to teach 30 seniors with no lecturer, the only help is your partner.

How did it feel?

You would expect my answer to be "anxious", "nervous", "uneasy".

Not exactly.

I might feel anxious because I was wet behind the ears. But that's not really a problem because every Lab Instructor was trained to teach and grasp the lesson outlines quickly. So, I would choose the "challenging" word to describe my feeling.

My first experience was teaching GIS (Spatial Mapping Tool & Analysis) to about 28-30 second-year IT Students, and I managed it well. Luckily I could explain more about Map Projection because I learned Geography in high school. üòÜ

### Lab Instructor Potential Test

Even after I finished that hellish training, to ensure that we got tons of programming knowledge, we were given 5 major tests (we called it ‚ÄúTes Potensi Asisten‚Äù) from game programming, web programming, and even mobile programming. That's a lot of skills to learn.

## The Employment Period (Updated)

I don't have much to say about the employment period because it was a repetitive task for about 2 years. But,

I can't deny that Bluejack has a lot of skills to offer every semester, it was like a warehouse of programming tutorials. Everything you want to learn, you will learn. Game? Mobile Apps? Desktop? Web? Animation? Desktop Game? Competitive Programming? Artificial Intelligence? Server Setup? You will find it.

### Pros and Cons

Every profession has pros and cons, and it depends on your preferences. Some people might like to work in Bluejack, others might not. That's why some people stay and others leave, it's normal.

As you know, the pros are tons of skills to learn and very supportive seniors and co-workers.

The cons may depend on each person, but mine was tiring and lack of career path.

For me, 2 years is enough to learn broad skills before I become a fresh graduate because **I have another dream to chase**, but I couldn't see it for 2 years in Bluejack.

## End of Contract

Time passed very quickly and I have taught over 800 students. I know student behaviors, approaching students, and even humorous experiences with students (Gosh, I missed this one).

Because most of my time I spent in the computer lab, I mostly learn new things and experiment with programming languages. So that developed my self-learning habit until now, which is a good thing because it makes us curious about everything.

Developing self-learning or self-taught capability is important particularly in the world of programming. Every year we discover new programming languages, major updates, new frameworks, or tools to make programmer work much easier. Company training classes might overcome the continuous changes of the programming world, but self-learning is a stress-free way to learn with our own style.

Here are some of my moments during my time as a Lab Instructor.

Not only from BINUS itself, sometimes my friends and seniors also hang out together and share our fun together on various occasions.
